== EM-REDIS

== DESCRIPTION:

An EventMachine[http://rubyeventmachine.com/] based library for interacting with the very cool Redis[http://code.google.com/p/redis/] data store by Salvatore 'antirez' Sanfilippo.
Modeled after eventmachine's implementation of the memcached protocol, and influenced by Ezra Zygmuntowicz's {redis-rb}[http://github.com/ezmobius/redis-rb/tree/master] library (distributed as part of Redis).

This library is only useful when used as part of an application that relies on
Event Machine's event loop.  It implements an EM-based client protocol, which
leverages the non-blocking nature of the EM interface to achieve significant
parallelization without threads.


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Implements most Redis commands (see {the list of available commands here}[http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference] with the notable
exception of MONITOR.

== SYNOPSIS:

Like any Deferrable eventmachine-based protocol implementation, using EM-Redis involves making calls and passing blocks that serve as callbacks when the call returns.  

  require 'em-redis'

  EM.run do
    redis = EM::Protocols::Redis.connect
    redis.errback do |err|
      puts err.inspect
      puts "Error code: #{err.code}" if err.code
    end
    redis.set "a", "foo" do |response|
      redis.get "a" do |response|
        puts response
      end
    end
    # We get pipelining for free
    redis.set("b", "bar")
    redis.get("a") do |response|
      puts response # will be foo
    end
  end

To run tests on a Redis server (currently compatible with 1.3)

  rake

Because the EM::Protocol::Memcached code used Bacon for testing, test code is
currently in the form of bacon specs.
